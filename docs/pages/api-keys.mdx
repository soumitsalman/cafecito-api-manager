# Get API Key

Beans uses API key authentication through the Zuplo developer portal.

## Prerequisites

- A registered developer account
- Access to this portal login

## Generate a key

1. Sign in to the developer portal.
2. Open your account/API keys section.
3. Create a new key for your app or environment.
4. Copy and store the key securely (secret manager recommended).

## Use the key in requests

Include the key in the `x-api-key` header:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://beans.cafecito.tech/health" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Key management guidance

- Use one key per app/environment (dev, staging, prod).
- Rotate keys on a regular schedule.
- Revoke immediately if you suspect exposure.
- Never commit keys into source control.

## Common auth issues

- `401 Unauthorized`: missing or invalid key
- `403 Forbidden`: key lacks required permissions
- `429 Too Many Requests`: throttle exceeded for current plan
