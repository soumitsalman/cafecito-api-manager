# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** September 16, 2024

## The short version

We collect what we need to run the service. We don't sell your data. We're not that kind of company.

## What we collect

- **Account info:** Name, email — the stuff you give us when you sign up.
- **Usage data:** IP address, browser info, timestamps, API call logs — standard operational stuff.
- **Cookies:** Session and preference cookies to keep things working. Nothing creepy.

## What we do with it

- Keep the service running and not on fire
- Improve the product (we actually look at usage patterns)
- Provide support when you yell at us
- Detect abuse and security issues
- Send you occasional product updates (with opt-out — we're not monsters)

## What we don't do

- Sell your data to advertisers
- Share it with random third parties for fun
- Mine it for crypto (that was last decade)

## Data retention

We keep data as long as we need it for operations, legal stuff, and security. When we don't need it, we delete it.

## Data transfer

Your data may be processed in the United States. We apply reasonable safeguards because that's what responsible adults do.

## Third-party services

We use third-party providers for infrastructure, analytics, and authentication. They have their own privacy policies — we pick ones that aren't terrible.

## Security

We use commercially reasonable safeguards. No system is 100% secure though, and anyone who tells you otherwise is lying.

## Your rights

Depending on where you live, you can request access, correction, deletion, or export of your data. Just ask.

## Kids

Our services aren't for children under 13. If you're under 13 and reading API documentation, that's impressive, but please get a parent involved.

## Changes

We may update this policy. We'll post changes here. If it's a big change, we'll make some noise about it.
