# About Our Mess

**[Project Cafecito](https://cafecito.tech)** is the brainchild of **Soumit Salman Rahman** and **Daniel Oliver Vidaud** — two tech geeks who thought, "Why not make life easier for people who actually work for a living?" We're building AI tools to handle the soul-crushing parts of running a business. We're a bootstrapped outfit — cause VCs can eat it.

## The Humans Behind This

### Soumit Salman Rahman
> [Blog](https://medium.com/@soumitsr) · [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/soumitsrahman/) · [X/Twitter](https://x.com/soumitsrah) 

Soumit's the guy who's built some stuff for Microsoft and Aurora Innovation. Computer engineer, product nerd, AI tinkerer. When he's not shipping code, he's probably over-caffeinated and arguing about distributed systems.

### Daniel Oliver Vidaud
> [Blog](https://personalizedtransformations.com/blog/) · [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dvidaud/) · [X/Twitter](https://x.com/DannyVidaud) 

Daniel's the aerospace nerd who made Boeing planes less chaotic. Pilot, operations strategist, and the kind of person who looks at a broken process and refuses to leave it alone until it works.

Together, we're trying to save you from the horrors of paperwork and bad workflows. No promises, but we're giving it a shot.

## What We're Building

Project Cafecito is a media product suite with real APIs that real developers can actually use:

- **Beans** — news & blog intelligence (live now)
- **Espresso** — original content from Espresso Publications (coming soon)
- **Cortado** — social media management (coming soon)

## Yell at Us

Complain, praise, or just say hi — we might even read it. (No guarantees.)
