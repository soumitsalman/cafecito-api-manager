# Terms of Use

**Effective Date:** September 16, 2024

**Cafecito API products** (including Beans, Espresso, and Cortado) are provided by **Project Cafecito**, a project under **Strategic Implementation Advising, LLC**. By using the service, you agree to these terms. If you don't agree, don't use it. Simple.

## 1. Acceptance of Terms

Using any Cafecito API product means you accept these terms and the [Privacy Policy](/company/privacy-policy). Continuing to use the service after we update terms means you accept the updates too.

## 2. Don't be a jerk

You agree not to:
- Misuse the service or interfere with operations
- Use the platform for anything illegal
- Try to reverse-engineer, scrape, or abuse the APIs
- Pretend to be someone you're not

Basically: use the APIs for their intended purpose and don't make us regret giving you access.

## 3. Intellectual property

Some of our code is open-source under their respective licenses. Everything else belongs to Strategic Implementation Advising, LLC or its licensors. Don't steal our stuff.

## 4. Disclaimer

Services are provided **"as is"** and **"as available."** No warranties. We do our best, but things break sometimes. That's software.

## 5. Limitation of liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, Strategic Implementation Advising, LLC is not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages. If the API goes down and you lose a deal, that's on you for not having a fallback. (Sorry, but lawyers made us say this.)

## 6. Your content

You're responsible for anything you submit through our services. Make sure you have the rights to share it.

## 7. Privacy

Your use is also governed by our [Privacy Policy](/company/privacy-policy). Go read it — it's actually pretty short.

## 8. Governing law

These terms are governed by the laws of **Washington State, USA**.

## 9. Changes

We may update these terms. We'll post changes here. Continued use after changes = acceptance.
