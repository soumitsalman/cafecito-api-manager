# Pricing

Beans uses simple per-request pricing tiers for news and blog intelligence workloads.

## Plans

| Plan | Monthly Price | Rate Limit | Quota | Availability |
| ---- | ------------- | ---------- | ----- | ------------ |
| Free (Launch Offer) | $0 | 100 req/min | 10,000 req/month | Effective now through Sep 30 |
| Broke & Beautiful | $5 | 100 req/min | 10,000 req/month | Starts Oct 1 |
| Baller & Bling | Still deciding... | 1,000 req/min | Unlimited req/month | Starts Oct 1 |

## Launch offer change

The **Free** launch offer is valid only through **Sep 30**.

Starting **Oct 1**, the Free tier will change to:

- **10 req/min** rate limit
- **1,000 req/month** quota

## What is included

- Access to keyword and semantic/vector search
- Metadata endpoints (categories, entities, regions, sources)
- Social engagement and trend-aware ranking signals
- Related-article graph features for propagation analysis
- API key management via developer portal

## Billing and quota rules

- There is **no soft limit**.
- Billing is **monthly**.
- If you hit your plan quota, access is capped until the next billing month.
- You can resume immediately by upgrading to a higher tier.

## Metering model

- We prefer simplicity over complex points systems, which is why Beans uses straightforward request/call-based metering.
- Metering is **per API call/request**.
- There is **no point system**.
- Response size and number of returned items do **not** change pricing.
- There is no additional pricing factor for MCP usage.
- There is no additional pricing factor for semantic/vector search.
- Requests that return zero results (for example, strict filters) still count as requests.
