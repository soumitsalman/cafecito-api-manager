# Beans API & MCP Developer Portal

Build on top of **Beans**, a news and blog intelligence API covering **7000+ sources** across
business, finance, technology, corporate blogs, and broader global topics.

Every day, Beans ingests and processes **25000+ new news and blog items** from those sources so you
can build on fresh, high-signal data.

Beans combines traditional search and AI-native retrieval so your product can move from keyword
matching to contextual discovery without changing platforms.

- **Vector/semantic search** for intent-based retrieval using embeddings
- **Trending signals** with social media engagement indicators
- **Related-article graphing** to track propagation across publishers
- **Built-in enrichment** including sentiment, entities, and regions
- **Fast JSON API** with pagination and filter controls
