# Cortado API — Coming Soon

**Status:** Not available yet. We're working on it.

Cortado will be Cafecito's **social media management** API. Think scheduling, posting, analytics — the kind of stuff that makes social media managers question their career choices, but automated.

## What to expect

- Social account management
- Content scheduling and publishing
- Engagement analytics
- Probably an MCP server too, because why not

## When?

When it's ready. We don't do fake launch dates.

In the meantime, check out [Beans](/howtos/beans-howto) — it's live and it's free during the [launch preview](/pricing/beans-pricing).
