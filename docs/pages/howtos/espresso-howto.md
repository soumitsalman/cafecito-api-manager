# Espresso — Coming Soon

**Status:** Not available yet.

Espresso is **Cafecito's own publishing arm** — original content from [Espresso](https://espresso.cafecito.tech). We'll expose it through APIs just like Beans, so you can integrate our content alongside third-party sources.

## What to expect

- Access to Cafecito-owned original content
- Same clean JSON format you know from Beans
- Search and filter capabilities
- MCP integration

## When?

Soon™. We'll update this page when there's something to show.

Meanwhile, [Beans](/howtos/beans-howto) is live and free during the [launch preview](/pricing/beans-pricing). Go play with that.
