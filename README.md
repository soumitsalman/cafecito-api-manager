## Zuplo API

This is a Zuplo API that was created with
[`create-zuplo-api`](https://zuplo.com/docs).

This repository is the overarching API manager for **Project Cafecito** products:

- Beans API & MCP (current)
- Cortado API & MCP (future)
- Latte API & MCP (future)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) with your browser to see the
result.

You can start editing product routes with the OpenAPI files in `config/`:

- `config/beans.oas.json`
- `config/cortado.oas.json`
- `config/latte.oas.json`

The dev server will automatically reload the API with your changes.
